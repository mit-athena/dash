.TH BUGME 1 "14 Jan 1997"
.ds ]W MIT Athena
.SH NAME
bugme \- login session timer and user irritant
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
bugme command [ option ... ]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIbugme\fR is intended to run on Athena workstations where limiting
an individual user's login time is desirable. These workstations are
intended for quick turnaround, allowing as many users as possible to
do things like check their mail between classes.

In order to facilitate this, \fIbugme\fR provides two services.
First, it places a login timer in the lower left-hand corner of the
user's display. This serves to give the user a constant indication of
how long they have been on, as well as any waiting users.

Second, \fIbugme\fR periodically reminds the user via dialog boxes
when they are over the recommended time for using the workstation.

The time counter in \fIbugme\fR is tamper-resistant (not tamper-proof)
in an effort to prevent less social users from concealing how long
they have been using the workstation. As a consequence, malicious acts
directed towards \fIbugme\fR or its windows may result in the user
being logged out.

The counter may be relocated from its default position by simply
clicking in it and dragging it around. It will always keep itself on
top of other windows and fully visible on the screen.

\fIbugme\fR is only intended to be run by the global Xsession script.
On machines where it is to be run (as determined by
/usr/athena/lib/quickstations), it executes its arguments in a child
process and waits for that process to exit. On machines where it is
not meant to be run, it simply executes its arguments.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
In sessions where \fIbugme\fR is active, the environment variable
ATHENA_QUICK is set so that custom user dotfiles can speed up the
login process if desired.
.SH OPTIONS
\fIbugme\fR's only arguments are the command to be executed and
its arguments.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The file \fI/usr/athena/lib/quickstations\fR contains the list of
machines, one hostname per line, on which \fIbugme\fR is to be active.
Case is ignored, and anything occurring on a line after a hostname
is also ignored.

\fIbugme\fR's app-defaults file contains the descriptions of what
messages should be used to remind the user, and when.

The "bugnames" resource lists the names of the dialog boxes that
should possibly be created while \fIbugme\fR runs.

	*bugnames:	first second last

Each dialog box to be created requires two resource specifications.
One is the text to occur in the dialog box (currently only one line).
The other is the specification of when it should occur.

	*first*question.label:      Please logout soon.
	*first*timeout:             540

This means that a dialog box saying "Please logout soon." should
be presented to the user about 540 seconds (9 minutes) after they
log in.

	*last*question.label:       Go now!
	*last*timeout:              1200 30

This dialog box will pop up 20 minutes after the user logs in,
and every 30 seconds thereafter.
.SH BUGS
\fIbugme\fR always wants to be on top of all other windows in order to
be visible. However, interesting things can happen when it encounters
other programs that want to do the same thing. Specifically,
\fIbugme\fR will fight with some screensaver software. Fortunately,
the side-effects are not damaging, and workstations where \fIbugme\fR
is run should not in principle be idle long enough for screensavers to
engage.
